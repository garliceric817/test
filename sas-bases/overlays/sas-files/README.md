# Change Alternate Data Storage for SAS Viya File Service
          
## Overview
          
The SAS Viya File Service uses PostgreSQL to store file metadata and content. However, PostgreSQL is unable to store large files. To overcome this limitation and make SAS Viya File Service scalable, you can choose to store the file content in other data storage, such as Azure Blob Storage. 
If you choose Azure Blob Storage as the storage database, then the file content is stored in Azure Blob Storage and file metadata remains in PostgreSQL.
         
The directory `$deploy/sas-bases/overlays/sas-files` contains an overlay to customize your SAS Viya deployment to make Azure Blob Storage the database for storing file content. 
       
## Instructions
          
1. Edit the base kustomization.yaml file (`$deploy/kustomization.yaml`) to add the following entries for generating the ConfigMap and adding a ConfigMap reference. 

* In the resources block, add `sas-bases/overlays/sas-files`. Here is an example:
                        
   ```yaml
   resources:
   ...
   - sas-bases/overlays/sas-files
   ...
   ```
            
* In the transformers block, add `sas-bases/overlays/sas-files/file-custom-db-transformer.yaml`. Here is an example:
            
   ```yaml
   transformers:
   ...
   - sas-bases/overlays/sas-files/file-custom-db-transformer.yaml
   ...
   ```
            
2. Follow the instructions in the "Configure SAS Viya File Service for Azure Blob 
Storage" README file to configure SAS Viya File Service. The README file is 
located at `$deploy/sas-bases/examples/azure/blob/README.md` (for Markdown format) 
or at `$ deploy/sas-bases/docs/configure_sas_viya_file_service_for_azure_blob_storage.htm` 
(for HTML format).
