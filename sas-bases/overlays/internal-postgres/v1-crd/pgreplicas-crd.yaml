                      description: Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty
                        means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values
                        are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                      description: Key is the taint key that the toleration applies
                        to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty,
                        operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all
                        values and all keys.

                        value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                        Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod
                        can tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                        this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it
                        is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not
                        evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict
                        immediately) by the system.

                        otherwise just a regular string.
